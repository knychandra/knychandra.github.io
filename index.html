        <p>On 1st September of 1998, Kenny Chandra was born in Surabaya, Indonesia. He has 4 brothers and 1 sister. 
            His father was an entrepreneur and his mother was a dress designer.</p>
        
        <h2 id = "early-days">Early Days</h2>
        <p> Kenny was not the smartest kid in his group. His grades were just okay, Kenny was not a bad student yet was 
            not the top of the class. He went to Gloria Elementary School and then he moved to Ciputra International School 
            in high school.</p>
        
        <h2 id = "university-life">University Life</h2>
        <p> His parents pushed him to pursue a degree in China. At first, Kenny declined it because he didn't really like 
            the environment of living in China. Not long after that, he did some research on how China was demolishing 
            America on Artificial Intelligence war. He suddenly wanted to pursue a degree there. 
            He went to University of Nottingham Ningbo China, a UK degree that is located in China.</p>
        
        <h2 id = "success-story">Success Story</h2>
        <p>Before he left Indonesia, he taught himself programming and relearned all of the mathematics that he didn't really 
            pay attention on. He was very commited and loved to watch motivational speeches from famous motivator at that
            time, <em>Jack Ma</em> was his role model. In Ningbo, he was a very diligent student and he learned coding at 
            his dorm room every evening. After years gone by, Kenny was graduated from Nottingham Ningbo University with 
            really good grades and he did some internships in famous companies like Google and Tesla in China.</p>
        <p>Kenny was immediately accepted to join Tesla's software engineering team in China. In Tesla, he met many 
            inspirational people. He met <em>Elon Musk</em> and Kenny became his student. Elon mentored Kenny 
            in many aspects in life not just in a professional field. They traveled the world and did some 
            business trip around Asia. In the late of 2032, Kenny and Elon had an idea to make artificial intelligence 
            robot that can accompany humans in their daily life. Just like in the movie <em>Ex Machina</em> 
            (Kenny's favorite AI and sci-fi based movie), they built the robot with their small team. 
            They went through ups and downs and gained their very first success in 2036. 
            Now, Kenny Chandra is listed on <u>Top 100 Most Influential People in the World by Forbes</u>. 
            He now helps people in Indonesia to get a better life.</p>
